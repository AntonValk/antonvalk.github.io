# ECSE 316 - Signals and Networks

I have been part of the ECSE 316 instructional team since Fall 2020, serving as a TA and lab instructor across three offerings (~90 students per semester). In Fall 2025 I am the instructor of record, responsible for leading lectures, coordinating labs, and updating the MATLAB- and Python-based tooling for complex signal analysis.

- Guided lab sections covering convolution, frequency-domain analysis, and system identification and created auto-graded notebooks to give students immediate feedback.
- Helped redesign homework rubrics and Piazza workflows, reducing response time to student questions by 60%.
- As instructor, I am refreshing the lecture sequence to weave in probabilistic signal processing and real-world telecom case studies, while mentoring the TA team on inclusive teaching practices.
