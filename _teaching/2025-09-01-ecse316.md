# ECSE 316 - Signals and Networks

I have been part of the ECSE 316 instructional team since Fall 2020, serving as a TA and lab instructor across three offerings (~90 students per semester). In Fall 2025 I was promoted to faculty lecturer of record, responsible for leading lectures, coordinating labs, and updating the Python-based tooling for complex signal analysis.

- Guided lab sections covering convolution, frequency-domain analysis as well as the fundamentals of networking.
- Managed two teaching assistants.
