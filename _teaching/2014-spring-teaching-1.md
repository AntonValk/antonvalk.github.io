# MAIS 202 - Intro to Machine Learning

I designed this zero-credit seminar for the McGill AI Society to give undergraduates a practical introduction to modern machine learning. Students completed weekly lectures, coding assignments, and final projects that emphasized both intuition and hands-on implementation.

- Delivered two offerings during Fall 2019 to cohorts of ~30 students each.
- Earned honorary accreditation from the McGill Faculty of Engineering so the course appears on official transcripts (0 credits).
- Produced the full curriculum, lecture material, and assessment rubrics covering supervised learning, neural networks, and applied ML tooling.
