# MAIS 202: Accelerated Introduction to Machine Learning

### Summary: 
This course was designed by AI-enthusiast students at the McGill Artificial Intelligence Society.
The aim of the course is to offer an extensive introduction to machine learning through lectures, assignments, and
projects. 
This course is meant for undergraduates at McGill with basic foundations in mathematics (Calculus, Linear Algebra) and programming (Python). While this course is
intended for lower-year undergraduates with an expressed interest in machine learning,
upper-year students who have been previously unable to take AI-related courses in McGill (e.g.
ECSE 415, COMP 424, COMP 551, ECSE 551) are welcome to apply!
