# ECSE 211 - Design Principles & Methods

From 2019 through 2025 I supported five offerings of ECSE 211 (~120 students per term) covering design methodology, prototyping, and project communication.

- Coached multidisciplinary project teams on requirements definition, robot prototyping, and technical writing.
- Ran design labs, grading sessions, and code reviews to keep student teams on track during intensive build weeks.
