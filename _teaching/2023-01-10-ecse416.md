# ECSE 416 - Intro to Telecommunications Systems

Across Winter 2020-2023 I TA'd three offerings of ECSE 416 (~40 students per semester), where I led weekly labs.

- Earned the departmental Teaching Award (top-ranked across 500+ Faculty of Engineering courses) for student mentorship and course-wide support queues.
- Supported exam design, office hours, and tutorial recordings focused on demystifying telecom abstractions through hands-on projects.
