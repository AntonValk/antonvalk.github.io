## EDUCATION


**Master of Science - Electrical Engineering (Thesis)** Sep 2019 to April 2021 (Expected)
McGill University - *GPA: 3.88*

- Research on deep learning for graph structures, multi-label classification and application to real world data.
- Recipient of the prestigious Alexander Graham Bell Scholarship; a highly competitive Canada-wide scholarship
awarded for academic excellence and research potential.

**Bachelor of Engineering - Electrical (Honours)** Sep 2015 to April 2019
McGill University - *GPA: 3.79*

- Honours program included graduate classes on machine learning, multi-agent systems, computer vision.

## WORK EXPERIENCE & PERSONAL PROJECTS

**Undergraduate Research Internship, McGill University** May 2018 to Aug 2019

- Developed a framework to apply computer vision techniques such as SR-CNN on electromagnetic problems for
simulating conductor potentials.
- Resulted in a peer-reviewed publication in IEEE conference Compumag 2019.
- Started off as an awarded USRA project for summer research but later joined with undergrad thesis.

**Academic Lecturer, McGill AI Society** Sep 2019 to April 2020

- Created the full content of a semester long extracurricular undergraduate level course to teach students modern
statistical learning and deep learning techniques.
- The course was recognized by the Dean of Engineering of McGill University and students who take it now have
it show up as a zero credit course on their official transcript.

**SDR Satellite Communication Project** Jan 2019 to June 2019
- Programmed a Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver and built an antenna to receive weather satellite images
from the NOAA satellite constellation.
- Work published by an education journal elaborating on how this project can be used as a lab in introductory
communication courses in engineering.

**MIO-TCD Challenge** Dec 2018
- Open challenge consisted of two parts: classification and localization of vehicles from 786,702 road images.
- Large amount of data (20 GB+) made training the models quite hard so Google cloud computing was used.
- Architecture consisted of two separate CNNs; one for localization and one for classification.

## EXTRACURRICULARS


McGill Greek Student Association April 2016 to Present
- Vice President of the club, organized events where current students, alumni, faculty, the local greek community
and the consul of Greece in Montreal.

Volunteer Tutor Sep 2014 to April 2015
