I was born in Athens, Greece and moved to Canada when I was 16. I finished my undergrad and started my Master's in McGill University. Currently part of the [ECE networks lab](http://networks.ece.mcgill.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Mark Coates](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~mcoate/). 

In my undergrad I was supervised by [Prof. Dennis Giannacopoulos](http://www.compem.ece.mcgill.ca/Dennis-Giannacopoulos.html) of the [COMPEM lab](http://www.compem.ece.mcgill.ca/index.html). 

My main research interests include deep learning in graphs, semi-supervised learning, and real world applications. In the past I have worked on electromagnetic problems and education in electrical engineering.
