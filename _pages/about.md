I am Antonios Valkanas and I come from Athens, Greece. I did my undergrad in McGill University in Montreal, Canada and I am currently pursuing my masters in the [ECE networks lab](http://networks.ece.mcgill.ca/) under the supervision of [Prof. Mark Coates](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~mcoate/). 

In my undergrad I was supervised by [Prof. Dennis GIannacopoulos](http://www.compem.ece.mcgill.ca/Dennis-Giannacopoulos.html) of the [COMPEM lab](http://www.compem.ece.mcgill.ca/index.html). 

My main research interests include deep learning in graph structures, semi-supervised learning, bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods. In the past I have worked on electromagnetic problems and education.
