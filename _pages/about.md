I am a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at McGill University, conducting my research at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [ILLS](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en/ills) with [Prof. Mark Coates](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~mcoate/). My work spans Bayesian and online learning, probabilistic reasoning with large language models, and graph-based representation learning, with a particular focus on controllable test-time compute and reliability.

I am Co-Founder and CTO of [Isidor](https://www.isidor.ai/), where we develop vertically integrated pipelines for post training foundational models in challenging business tasks.

In 2024 and 2025 I completed two Applied Scientist internships at Amazon (Seattle), where I built multi-modal pricing models for 100M+ items, introduced epistemic uncertainty quantification techniques, and delivered systems that were deployed into production. I have also collaborated with Unity Labs and Quantum Technologies on motion animation in the Unity game engine, recommender systems, and graph learning research.

Teaching and mentorship were a major part of my work at McGill. I was the course  lecturer for ECSE 316 (Signals and Networks) in Fall 2025.  I have served as a TA and lab instructor for multiple semester for ECSE 316 (Signals and Networks), ECSE 416 (Intro to Telecommunications Systems), and ECSE 211 (Design Principles & Methods), [winning the best teaching award in the Faculty of Engineering](https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards/teaching-assistant-awards) among over 200 courses offered by the Faculty. I also designed and taught the student led [MAIS 202 - Intro to Machine Learning](https://mcgillai.com/) seminar with the McGill AI Society during my undergrad.
