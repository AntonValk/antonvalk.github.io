I am a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at McGill University, conducting my research at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [ILLS](https://www.mcgill.ca/ills/) with [Prof. Mark Coates](http://www.ece.mcgill.ca/~mcoate/). My work spans Bayesian and online learning, probabilistic reasoning with large language models, and graph-based representation learning, with a particular focus on controllable test-time compute and reliability.

In 2024 and 2025 I completed two Applied Scientist internships at Amazon (Seattle), where I built multi-modal pricing models for 100M+ items, introduced epistemic uncertainty quantification techniques such as Multi-SWAG, and delivered systems that were deployed into production. I have also collaborated with Unity Technologies Labs and Quantum Technologies on motion animation, recommender systems, and graph learning research.

Teaching and mentorship remain a major part of my work at McGill. I have served as a TA and lab instructor for ECSE 316 (Signals and Networks), ECSE 416 (Intro to Telecommunications Systems), and ECSE 211 (Design Principles & Methods), and I will be the instructor for ECSE 316 in Fall 2025. I also designed and taught the zero-credit MAIS 202 - Intro to Machine Learning seminar with the McGill AI Society.
